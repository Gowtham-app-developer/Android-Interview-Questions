# Android Architecture

## Android Jetpack

-	Android Jetpack is a collection of Android software components which helps us in building Android apps.
-	These software components helps in reducing the boilerplate code and making complex things very simple.

## Android Architecture Components

-	The __Android Architecture Components__ is the collection of libraries that helps developers to design clean, robust, testable and maintainable apps. 
- __LiveData__ is used to build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
-	__ViewModel__ stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations.
-	__Room__ is a SQLite object mapping library and we used it to avoid boilerplate code and easily convert SQLite table data to Java objects. 
-	__Data Binding__ helps in declaratively binding UI elements to in our layout to data sources of our app.
-	__WorkManager__ manage every background jobs in Android with the circumstances we choose.

## Data Binding

- The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than           programmatically.
- Data binding has the following benefits (i.e.) Code is shorter and easier to read, Easier to maintain than code, Removes the lot of boilerplate code, Data and views are         clearly   separated.

## View Model

-	The ViewModel is a part of Android Architecture Components. 
- The ViewModel class is designed to hold and manage UI-related data in a life-cycle conscious way. 
- This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
- View model create in the memory when activity creates, it lives until the activity cleared from the memory and So ViewModel can hold value belong to the activity.

__Advantages of using ViewModel__

- Live through the configuration changes- If any configuration changes the data will live in ViewModel.
- No worry about leak memory
- Data will be always updated â€“ If API is calling data from remote server the data will always update.
- Data will wait for you- If you call any APIs and that time you will rotate the phone and result delivered before activity recreation data will store in ViewModel and wait for   the re-creation of activity
